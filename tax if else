//Create a java program that will accept the gross salary and print the net salary.  Assume 10% tax will be deducted if the gross salary is greater than 10,000, else 5%.

        double fivepercent = (gross*0.95);
        double tenpercent = (gross*0.90);
        
        if (gross >= 10000) {
            System.out.print("10% tax is deducted: " + tenpercent);
