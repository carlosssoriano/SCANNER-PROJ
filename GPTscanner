Questions Scenario:
You want to create a program that asks a user the following questions:

What is your name?
How old are you?
What is your favorite color?
What is your favorite number?




import java.util.Scanner;

public class SimpleQuestionnaire {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Scanner object to take input from the user
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Ask for the user's name
        System.out.print("What is your name? ");
        String name = scanner.nextLine();

        // Ask for the user's age
        System.out.print("How old are you? ");
        int age = scanner.nextInt();

        // Ask for the user's favorite color
        System.out.print("What is your favorite color? ");
        String color = scanner.next();  // Using next() here since color is a single word

        // Ask for the user's favorite number
        System.out.print("What is your favorite number? ");
        int favoriteNumber = scanner.nextInt();

        // Display the user's answers
        System.out.println("\nThank you, " + name + "! Here is what we know about you:");
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
        System.out.println("Favorite Color: " + color);
        System.out.println("Favorite Number: " + favoriteNumber);

        // Close the scanner to prevent resource leaks
        scanner.close();
    }
}
