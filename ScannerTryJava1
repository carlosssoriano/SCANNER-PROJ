You want to create a program that asks a user the following questions:

What is your name?
How old are you?
What is your favorite color?
What is your favorite number?


import java.util.Scanner;

public class Scanner1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
 
       
        // lowercase scanner is can be change
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.println("What is your name? ");
        String name = scanner.nextLine();
        
        System.out.println("How old are you? ");
        int age = scanner.nextInt();
        
        System.out.println("What is your favorite color? ");
        String color = scanner.next();
        
        System.out.println("What is your favourite number? ");
        int favnumber = scanner.nextInt();
        
        System.out.println("\nMy name is " + name);
        System.out.println("I am " + age);
        System.out.println("My favorite color is " + color);
        System.out.println("My favorite number is " + favnumber);
        
        scanner.close();
    }
}
