// Write a simple number guessing game where the program chooses a random number between 1 and 100, 
and the user has to guess it. The program should tell the user if their guess is too low, too high, 
or correct.




import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		System.out.print("Enter your guess: ");
		int inputguess = sc.nextInt();
		
		if (inputguess == 26) {
		    System.out.print("You are correct!");
		}
		
		if (inputguess <= 25) {
		    System.out.print("Nice try!");
		}
		
		if (inputguess >= 27) {
		    System.out.print("Nice try!");
		}
		
		
		
		sc.close();
